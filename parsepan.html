                [ <I>pan</I><B>_</B><I>verification</I><B>_</B><I>report(s)</I> ]


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>parsepan</B> is a script to parse the results of SPIN's pan verifier.
       <B>parsepan</B> writes the information as data values to the standard output.
       In its default setting, all data values found are written on a single
       line delimited by tabs. The format of the ouptut can be customized
       through several options. Apart from SPIN's standard verification
       report, <B>parsepan</B> recognizes the output added by the <B>runspin</B> script.  If
       no input files are specified on the command-line, the input is read
       from the standard input.

       <B>parsepan</B> makes it easy to collect specific information from SPIN's
       verification reports and to export a comma separated values (csv) file,
       which can be imported into analysis software such as a spreadsheet.  In
       connection with runspin, <B>parsepan</B> can serve as unit test tool for
       Promela specifications.

       To identify parts of the verification report, <B>parsepan</B> uses names for
       specific items in the report, e.g., state_vector, errors, atomic_steps,
       etc.  A verification report can thus be seen as a list of <I>(key,value)</I>
       pairs, where <I>key</I> is the name of the item, and <I>value</I> is the specific
       value as found in the verification report.

       When multiple verification reports are specified (or when the input is
       the standard input), <B>parsepan</B> will print the values of each report on a
       separate line.  <B>parsepan</B> will use the first verification report as
       reference point: for all subsequent verification reports only the items
       as found on the first report will be included (and in the same order).
       For missing items, a dash "-" will be included.  This means that all
       <I>columns</I> of the different lines (the rows) will correspond with the same
       <I>key.</I>


</PRE>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2><PRE>
       <B>-h</B>,  <B>--help</B>
              Prints the synopsis of the script and the possibly options.

       <B>-a</B>,  <B>--allnames</B>
              The script dumps all <I>key</I> names that are recognized by parsepan.
              This list can serve as a starting point to build a custom
              <I>keyfile</I> (see below), to specify the keys that one is interested
              in.

       <B>-d</B>,  <B>--delimiter</B> c | t | =
              Specifies the delimiter between the data values.  Only three
              possible delimiters are currently supported.  The character <I>c</I>
              corresponds with the comma, the character <I>t</I> corresponds with the
              tab character, and the character <I>=</I> is simply the equal sign.  By
              default, the delimiter is a tab.

       <B>-k</B> <B>,</B>   <B>--keyfile</B> <I>keyfile</I>
              By default, parsepan will output <I>all</I> values that it finds in the
              verification report.  One is usually only interested in a subset
              of these values.  When using this option, parsepan will only
              report on the values of the keys that are in the <I>keyfile.</I>
              parsepan will respect the order of the keys in the <I>keyfile</I>, when
              printing the values.

       <B>-l</B>,  <B>--lines</B>
              Instead of printing all values on a single line, this option
              will dump all <I>(key,value)</I> pairs to the standard output; each
              pair will be printed on a single line, and the <I>key</I> and <I>value</I>
              will be delimited by an equal sign (=).

       <B>-q</B>,  <B>--quotes</B>
              This option will make sure that all values that are being
              printed will be enclosed in double quotes. This is useful when
              the output of parsepan (e.g., csv format) is used as input for a
              third party program (e.g., a spreadsheet) that requires quoted
              values.

       <B>-s</B>,  <B>--summary</B>
              Prints a very concise summary of the verification report.  It
              only prints the values for the following keys: <I>rs</I><B>_</B><I>promela</I><B>_</B><I>file,</I>
              <I>rs</I><B>_</B><I>config</I><B>_</B><I>name,</I> <I>errors,</I> <I>states</I><B>_</B><I>stored,</I> <I>state</I><B>_</B><I>vector.</I>  This is
              useful when parsepan is used as unit test tool.

       <B>-t</B>,  <B>--header</B>
              Includes all <I>key</I> names as a header row before the first line of
              values.  This is useful when exporting the results to a third
              party program.

       <B>-v</B>,  <B>--version</B>
              Prints the version number of parsepan and exits.

       <B>-x</B>,  <B>--debug</B>
              The debug option will print all non-empty lines in the
              verification report that parsepan did not recognize. This option
              was useful in identifying all lines that can be printed by a pan
              verifier.

<H2>EXAMPLES</H2><PRE>
       runspin -p -n deadlock peterson.prom | parsepan --header --delimiter c
              The Promela model <I>peterson.prom</I> is verified according to
              configuration <I>deadlock</I>. The verification reports are fed to
              parsepan, which shows all data values on a single line, headed
              by the names of the keys. The (abbreviated) output would look
              like this:

              rs_promela_file,rs_verification_date,rs_spin_version, ...
              peterson.prom,16-Apr-2014 13:00:00,Spin Version 6.2.7 -- 2 March 2014, ...

       runspin -a -p peterson.prom | parsepan --summary
              First all configurations found in <I>peterson.prom</I> are verified.
              The output of these verification reports is read by parsepan,
              which then reports a summary of the verification reports:

              peterson.prom   deadlock    0   32  20
              peterson.prom   mutex       0   32  36
              peterson.prom   progress    0   62  36

<H2>DEPENDENCIES</H2><PRE>
       parsepan is a Python script and (apart from SPIN and optionally
       runspin) it only requires Python to be installed.

<H2>ADDITIONAL NOTES</H2><PRE>
       To automate the verification process with SPIN there is also an utility
       called <B>runspin</B>, which has been developed hand-in-hand with <B>parsepan</B>.
       <B>parsepan</B> recognizes the information added by the <B>runspin</B> script.

<H2>HISTORY</H2><PRE>
       <B>parsepan</B> is (loosely) based on the perl script <B>ppr</B> (parse pan reports)
       which was developed in 2000/2001. Its purpose was to batch process SPIN
       verification reports.  <B>ppr</B> has been used extensively for the
       experiments in [Ruys 2001].
